Part C: Description
The website is my portfolio that is documenting my design experience in college. Ideally, this portfolio will be sent to employers to allow them to understand my design style and get to know me a little bit more. The main information I'm trying to convey is my thought process on design projects. This includes everything from how I approach UX research and brainstorming to the preferred software I use for high-fidelity prototyping (Figma!). I try to keep it interesting and engaging through the javascript additions and the stylistic choices. The stylistic choices are designed to create a smooth and enjoyable user experience that feels fun and light (i.e. lots of brighter colors, circles, etc.). The website is interesting through parallax motion, which means that the foreground content scrolls faster than the background design, which gives the illusion of depth. That way, users can enjoy the website while their attention is still focused on the text. The target audience includes employers, design enthusiasts, and people who want to learn more about me as a designer. While this is frequently used in the professional context (i.e. for hiring), my portfolio is a great representation of who I am and what I'm capable of, which is why I don't mind sharing it with friends and family. 

Part D: Using your website
Navigation Bar: clicking on any of the headers will lead to the appropriate page; clicking on my resume will open an external page
Home Page: scrolling to the bottom of the home page, the user can hover their mouse over each of the projects for the card to flip and see some project information/summaries
Project Pages (under “work”): all 3 of the project pages (and the rest of my website) have the parallax scroll effects implemented; you’ll see the circles in the background moving slower than the text. All projects also have a table of contents that fades in and can redirect the user to any section with a click
Other Creative Projects: many different types of media can be seen/experienced on this page; there are embedded YouTube videos, case documents, and more
About: clicking on any of the large circles at the bottom of the page will link the user to another tab that has the club’s website and information.

Part E: External libraries
Bootstrap: I used Bootstrap because of all of the implementation benefits and ease of use. Many of the elements (navigation, project cards, etc.) were all from Bootstrap, which made it easier to give the website a more polished, dynamic feel. It also made it easy to manage things like helper libraries (ex. Scrollspy, which helped manage the project table of contents). Bootstrap made it also very easy to make the project responsive.
Jarallax: I used Jarallax because I really wanted a javascript-based parallax scrolling effect for my website to add to the look and feel. Jarallax, in particular, was easy to use and implement with the Bootstrap framework. It made the overall experience more dynamic and added a sense of depth and realness to the user experience. 

Part F: Iteration from HW7
The major iterations were mainly in the project page, like the inclusion of the fading in the table of contents. The parallax scroll effect and flipping cards were also not visible until now. 

Part G: Major challenges
The major challenge I faced while implementing the website was mainly the learning curve of outside libraries. While they’re designed to be easy to use, any library still takes a lot of time to learn and implement well. I also had lots of small issues with the quirks of combining multiple libraries and fitting the parallax library into the bootstrap framework.
