                            Makers/Entrepreneurs love working on their personal projects,
                            but don't like to market themselves and their products; they
                            feel "icky" when they advertise their products on social media
                            and other platforms.

                            During the CMU HCII independent study titled "Makers Making Money",
                            I was asked to analyze a business problem plaguing makers/entrepreneurs
                            and find/prototype a solution. After analyzing pre-recorded
                            customer interviews, I sketched out a few potential designs
                            and ended up selecting a marketing app to prototype in Figma.
                            The app provided makers with a calming interface to manage their
                            social media platforms, plan and create online content, and explore
                            a customized social media "feed" with content inspiration from 
                            similar makers.

                        <p>
                            I was working on this project through CMU's HCII program, which
                            offers students of all majors an opportunity to work with faculty
                            or phD students on a specific project or topic. For the "Makers Making Money"
                            project, I was advised by Nik Martelaro, an Assistant HCII Professor.
                            While it was a solo project, I was in a cohort of 4 students all
                            working on individual projects inspired from the same set of interviews.
                            We met bi-weekly through Zoom to present project progress and provide feedback.

                        <h2 class="section-header">Role</h2>
                        <p>
                            Since this was a personal project, I was in charge of defining
                            the UX problem, ideating/iterating on potential solutions,
                            and ultimately prototyping the final product. I was, however,
                            fortunate enough to have guidance from my advisor as he identified
                            out potential problems, mentioned potential ideas to explore, 
                            and provided holistic project feedback.

                        <p>
                           Coming into the project, the professor provided us with some pre-recorded user interviews
                           that were conducted by students the previous semester. Thus, I analyzed the
                           interviews to find the key consumer pain points. Overall, the main theme was
                           that many of the users were simply doing these activities as hobbies, but
                           were unconfident on the business aspects; these included marketing, finance,
                           pricing, etc.
                        </p>
                    </div>
            
                    <div class="container-fluid" id="Design-Process-Intro">
                        <h2 class="section-header">Design Process</h2>
                        <p>
                            Being my first project, the depth of steps were a little bit limited and
                            thus did not contain some steps like user testing due and final implementation
                            due to logistical issues. For this project, the UX process consisted of:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Ideation based on the primary research - Here, I was
                                    exploring different business problems and solutions that
                                    makers brought up during the recorded interviews.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Lo-Fi Mockups -  This stage was dedicated to some parallel
                                    prototyping, meaning I was creating rough mockups for a few different
                                    business solutions (instead of iterating off of one prototype). 
                                    While parallel prototyping is usually done in the context of one problem, 
                                    I still found this an effective way to narrow down the best problem statement
                                    and solution. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Branding - After narrowing down my problem and solution, I began
                                    to think about the goals of my design and how I could leverage them
                                    in the context of the current problem. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Hi-Fi Mockups - Finally, I prototyped my app idea in Figma that
                                    had all of the features I wanted to add; I was also simultaneously
                                    implementing my brand identity (colors, goals, etc.) as I added
                                    created my final mockup. 
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="container-fluid" id="Design-Process-Ideation">
                        <h2  class="section-header">Ideation</h2>
                        <p>
                            Due to the amount of freedom in HCII independent studies, I first needed
                            to define my project scope because there were so many possible topics and
                            areas I could tackle. My approach was very similar to a parallel-prototyping
                            process: I had 6 ideas in completely different sectors of business. While I
                            wasn't necessarily prototyping my ideas, I was finding potential sketches
                            and drew some very rough sketches of what these ideas would look like to help
                            visualize them. The parallel prototyping helped me quickly explore multiple options
                            at once, without becoming too attached to the first solution.

                            After meeting with my advisor, we decided that the marketing idea and 
                            mentorship apps were the most attractive ideas; the other ones either:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Already had market implementation (ex. "Managing Channels": an app
                                    that would manage direct messages from different platforms or communication channels,
                                    like Facebook, Instagram, etc.)
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Required a lot of information from the user; wouldn't be much of an app
                                    but a service that records data
                                    (ex. "BMC Made easy": an app
                                    that would help you understand the 'Business Model Canvas' (a tool for developing a company's
                                    business logistics) based on inputted information, which would be a lot!)
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the next week I developed the details of both applications. The marketing app was designed to 
                            help makers find the ideal digital media channels and marketing strategies based on their target audience. 
                            The app would also assist with marketing help in specific areas, like creating the best ad for the Google ad
                            purchasing process, or calculating Key Performance Indicators (i.e. marketing metrics to show how effective 
                            an advertising strategy is).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After another chat with my advisor and a rough competitive analysis, we decided that the marketing app 
                            provided the most unique solution to makers that was not currently on the market. While there are
                            social media management applications, many of them don't have integrations to for those looking to discover
                            their ideal marketing strategy or post inspiration from their peers.

                        <p>
                            In order to develop the marketing platform idea, I began with a lo-fi mockup
                            of the platform. The mockup helped clarify the user flow, application layout, 
                            and logistical features needed at each stage. 
                        </p>

                            The first two boxes (top left and center left) show the beginning stages; 
                            ideally, a new user would download the app, type in very simple/minimal
                            information on their product, and through machine learning/comprehensive
                            datasets, the app would suggest engaging audiences and platforms, which would
                            all have in-app integrations. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The other four boxes are "snapshots" of each of the app features. Since
                            many makers weren't excited about managing business/marketing logistics,
                            the different pages allow for easy flow between planning, creating, exploring,
                            and analyzing content. In the context of usability heuristics (i.e. important design
                            principles), the layout tries to stay consistent with typical apps; many of the
                            components (the navigation bar, the feed, the calendar, etc.) try to make the app
                            really easy to use by reusing components familiar to makers (or anyone who has used
                            social media/other similar platforms).

                            In order to convert my lo-fi prototype into a hi-fi prototype, 
                            I tried to keep a few core principles in mind as I chose the colors,
                            theme, and overall image of the app.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Calming - Many makers expressed unpleasant emotions (e.g. icky, frustrated, etc.) associated with
                                    trying to market yourself and your products. Thus, the app's mild color pallette
                                    and prevalant nature imagery helps creatives feel a little bit more at easy
                                    while dealing with some of the more uncomfortable aspects of being an entrepreneur.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Distilled - Makers and creatives usually have little-to-no background in business. Thus,
                                    the platform needed to be intentional in its text and images. As I designed
                                    the app, it was important to make many of the features, visuals, and text easy to comprehend
                                    since makers may not have advanced knowledge of business/marketing terms and 
                                    probably didn't have time or weren't interested.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Elevating - Many makers expressed that in an ideal world, they wouldn't need 
                                    to promote themselves. Thus, it was vital to design the app with lots of auto-fill/inspiration
                                    features to make it easier for makers to create and improve their marketing content.
                                </li>

                            input page. The input page allows new users to get marketing strategy recommendations based on
                            their product selection. In order to minimize information required, the program would (in theory)
                            use machine learning/neural networks, or figure out the best strategies based on a large dataset of
                            past products and their successful strategies. The user can then select their favorite strategies.

                            This project helped me develop fundamental design skills and tools for future
                            projects. This was my first time going through the ideation process and taught
                            me the importance of parallel prototyping and testing out multiple ideas. Especially
                            in the early stages, having so many different ideas and thoughts gave me options to
                            assess project strengths and weaknesses and stay adaptable. This also was my first
                            time really analyzing the effects of design and how I can leverage design to
                            tackle user problems. The overall branding, styles, colors, etc. were all created to
                            harmoniously work together to bring a unique and fun user experience, which was
                            fascinating process to think through. (I also had a lot of fun with the pen tool; the
                            background tree was entirely made from scratch and determination!)

                            If I had more time, I would love to conduct user testing to see how consumers would
                            interact with my prototype and what they would feel during the entire experience. Since
                            the goal of the design is to simultaneously evoke an emotion (peace/comfort) while
                            accomplishing user tasks, there's a lot of potential in conducting user testing to see
                            how best to improve the overall experience. Moreover, being able to roughly prototype
                            the project (or talking to someone who can) would be very interesting because of the
                            heavy reliance on technology and advanced programs (i.e. machine learning algorithms). This
                            would also be the perfect opportunity to try out Wizard of Oz prototyping, which means
                            having a user test out the app while I (the "Wizard of Oz") would simulate the algorithms
                            and provide the potential marketing strategies, marketing advice, etc.
