                            College Students want to prioritize their health, but don't 
                            have the time, knowledge or motivation on how to do it.

                            Amazon wanted a marketing strategy for Amazon Prime Student. 
                            Our product team decided that we should create a gamified health 
                            platform, but wasn't clear on the details. I established the 
                            UX problem statement and created an "Prime Health" website designed 
                            to make it easy and fun for college students to prioritize their health 
                            while engaging with Amazon Prime Student benefits.

                            For an Amazon Prime Student Case Competition, Amazon wants an Amazon 
                            Prime Student marketing plan targeted at Gen Z/current college freshman. 
                            After doing some research and establishing our course of action, our 
                            product team pivoted to a more competitive idea. Our product team 
                            proposed a single, centralized Amazon Prime Student Health platform that, with the 
                            right features, would help Gen Z engage with Prime Student benefits. 
                            It'd also make Amazon a more palatable company to purchase from, as 
                            they'd be supporting student health. 
                        </p>

                            I (as the Design Lead and only UX Designer) had to create a mockup of 
                            the platform. While the product team had a rough idea of the features 
                            they wanted (a dashboard, some goals, and a leaderboard), they didn't 
                            have any of the specifics of the information they wanted to include, 
                            data they wanted to display, logistical details, etc. Thus, much of 
                            these details were left for me to explore. 
                        </p>
                    </div>
            
                    <div class="container-fluid" id="Interviews">
                        <h2 class="section-header">Research: Interviews</h2>
                        <p>
                            At the current stage of the project, we had consumer research but no 
                            information on student's health prioritization or pain points. Since 
                            I was beginning consumer interviews with the primary research team, 
                            I proposed additional health questions to evaluate the solution's 
                            overall potential. Since we were forming our product in parallel, 
                            however, we were restricted in question specificity, since we didn't 
                            know what our health platform would entail.
                        </p>
            
                        <p>
                            The health questions investigated user's perceived importance of 
                            health and exercise, their current (time) investments into health 
                            and exercise, and any particular metrics/health aspects they were 
                            interested in. While many of the college freshmen wanted to prioritize 
                            health and exercise, many of them didn't have enough time to dedicate 
                            it. Users didn't have particular metrics they wanted to see; since 
                            they didn't have workouts or regular exercise sessions, they didn't 
                            know what should be measured.
                        </p>
            
                        <p>
                            From here, we found a problem our theoretical health platform could 
                            solve: College Students want to prioritize their health, but don't 
                            have the time or knowledge on how to do it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For the design process we had to create the whole UX in about two weeks, 
                            due to our recent pivot. Our new Prime Health platform revolved 
                            around a centralized dashboard with some sort of health statistics, 
                            as well as emphasizing our three main areas of focus: physical health, 
                            mental health, and community health. The user data would be gathered 
                            from the Amazon Halo Band, i.e. an Amazon brand smart watch.
                        </p>
            
                        Prototype Goals and Low-Fidelity (Lo-fi) Prototype
                        <p>
                            Our lo-fi prototype consisted of a rough mockup given by one of the 
                            members of the product team:
                            <div class="container">
                                <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/Prototype_Lo-Fi_1.jpg" 
                                    alt="Lo-Fi Prototype (1)" width="600rem">
                                <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/Prototype_Lo-Fi_2.jpg" 
                                    alt="Lo-Fi Prototype (2)" width="600rem">
                                <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="assets/Prototype_Lo-Fi_3.jpg" 
                                    alt="Lo-Fi Prototype (2)" width="600rem">
                            </div>
                        </p>
            
                        <p>
                            To convert this to a high-fidelity (hi-fi) prototype, I wanted to emphasize a few of
                            important features from the original prototype goals:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Personalized experience, centered around an “Alexa” influencer 
                                and/or a personalized player/profile picture
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                A fun and clean interface to encourage daily platform use and 
                                engagement with health-related activities
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                An interesting way to engage and create an online Prime Student 
                                community and leverage social networks to spur website adoption
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>
                    <div class="container-fluid" id="Design-Process-Branding">
                        <h2  class="section-header">Branding</h2>
                        <p>
                            While Amazon provides a Prime Student style guide, I had a few 
                            overarching design themes to optimize it for college students:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Simple - the overall UX, while being very densely packed with 
                                information, is intended to be simplistic to make it easy for 
                                users to improve their health (with our website).
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Central Alexa and user avatars - to engage users we wanted to 
                                have a personalized avatar across many of the pages. Many of 
                                the pages also include Alexa in the top left corner for tips and 
                                navigational help. Ideally, later prototypes would have interactive 
                                animated avatars. 
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Circles and Waves/Liquid - Whether it's the point clusters or 
                                quick goals, the frequent use of circles across the page is 
                                designed to be soft on the user's eyes while still being visually 
                                appealing. There are also “waves” of liquid representing 
                                completeness on the quick goals; these were inspired by the 
                                Aetna Health App, and I felt it was a visually intriguing but 
                                calming way to easily see the goal completeness. 
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                            user's progress and to celebrate or encourage the user's current engagement 
                            levels. It features a central semi-circle that tracks the user's weekly 
                            health progress along (our) three dimensions: physical, mental, and 
                            community health. Each of these health aspects are tracked with a different 
                            metric (see weekly goals) and have an associated color, which stays 
                            consistent across pages.

                        <p>
                            The main dashboard statistics were influenced by primary research/interviews; 
                            since our interviewed college freshmen didn't know what metrics would be 
                            best, I chose simple measurements that were easy to quantify and compare,
                            like steps and time.

                            The “Quick Goals” page showcases challenges the user can complete within 
                            a limited amount of time to receive extra points. Since each bubble 
                            represents a goal, I designed the bubbles to expand as the time decreased, 
                            to further emphasize challenges that were about to expire (or “pop!”). 
                            Its background color also matches its respective health aspect. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The page also features bubbles with the same “waves” to give the website 
                            a sense of cohesion. The goals also feature point multipliers for health 
                            categories that the user could spend more time practicing/emphasizing. 
                            For example, students who don't like to run (and often don't complete 
                            running goals) would be given bonus points for running goals.

                            changes each month. Amazon would match donations based on community point 
                            totals. This allows Amazon to celebrate Gen Z's philanthropic desires

                            the most points and see their profiles. Each of the profiles includes 
                            the user's (selected) favorite exercises and an option to give points 
                            to each other (which was found in the user interviews to be an 
                            interesting/engaging feature). The leaderboard would create maintained interest
                            in the app and fuel users' motivation through competition.

                            tool for Amazon. These include things like “free 1 month Course Hero trial,” 
                            “$20 Amazon gift card,” “1 free article of clothing from Prime Wardrobe,” and more.

                            Being the sole UX designer and the design lead with only one other 
                            designer, all of the project design responsibility fell on my hands. 
                            Before our strategy pivot, my only responsibility was the case 
                            document design. However, we were now responsible for prototype 
                            mockups of our Prime Health platform, with a loose framework provided 
                            by the product team. Thus, I took on the responsibility to convert 
                            these ideas into a prototype with only a month before the case was due.
                        </p>
            
                        <p>
                            With so little time to finish the design work for the case, I had to 
                            arrange how to fit in the rest of the design work within the next 
                            month between two people. We now had website UX deliverables in addition 
                            to the overall case design and implementation. Due to the tight 
                            timeline and unfinalized strategy, the design work had to happen in 
                            parallel with the product team's current deadlines.

                        <p>
                            To fit everything in on time, I created a rough timeline of all the 
                            tasks we needed to complete and divided them among our two designers 
                            based on our respective strengths. Since we were both full-time 
                            students, however, the deadlines had to be flexible and accommodate 
                            for the final exam season.

                        <p>
                            The design work helped solidify our overall case strategy by providing 
                            concrete visuals for the judges. Our case competition team was awarded
                            "commendable" by the American Marketing Association judges.

                            This project taught me how to work with non-designers and turn their 
                            ideas into a full-fledged design. This meant understanding the core 
                            vision of the project and using their vision as a guideline to designing 
                            a website. To do this, I also had to find the core UX problem statement 
                            within their proposal. Since the product team simply wanted a 
                            “Health Website”, I had to find a relevant problem that the platform 
                            would be solving. Finally, I had to develop some project management 
                            skills by effectively dividing work among two people in order to 
                            finish the project on time.
                
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If I had more time, it would be nice to actually go through the full 
                            design process and iterate through platform features, conduct usability 
                            tests, and possibly even try website implementation. With more people, 
                            I could also focus more on honing in on the problem statement with more 
                            in-depth interviews and more detailed idea generation. Though this 
                            project was slightly backwards (i.e. receiving the solution before the 
                            problem) due to the timeline, I think we still managed to discover 
                            and solve a relevant problem while simultaneously creating a product 
                            that satisfies the main case goals.
