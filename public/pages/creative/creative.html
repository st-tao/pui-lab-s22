            <p>
                I love being a designer, but I also love expressing my creativity in different ways.
                Here are a few different projects I've worked on recently. Some are video editing, some are 
                music, but they were all a lot of fun to create!
            </p>

            <h2>Last Concept Video: HCI for Startups</h2>
            <h3>Concept Designer, Actor, Video Editor</h3>
            <p>
                This was a fun concept video I made with a partner for an HCI class; the prompt was to 
                create a concept video for a new email client. Our product summarized emails
                to make it easier for busy people to read through them and give more time
                to themselves.

            <h2>Last Acapella Performance: Treblemakers</h2>
            <h3>Beatboxer, Video Editor</h3>
            <p>
                Over the pandemic, I edited the music videos for my acapella group.
                The last two videos were "Dancing With the Devil" by Demi Lovato and
                "Side" by Pentatonix. This year, our group won 2nd place in ICCA 
                Quarterfinals and I won outstanding vocal percussion!

            <h2>Last Document Design: PODS Case Competition Document</h2>
            <h3>Document Designer</h3>
            <p>
                For a case competition hosted by the American Marketing Association, I designed
                the case document we submitted to be adjudicated. The document was made with 
                Adobe InDesign and the cover page was designed in Adobe Illustrator. I made a few different
                possible cover designs and then designed the case document based on the cover. While 
                it's not perfect, it was a great learning experience for both cover and document design!
            </p>

            <h2>Last Percussion Performance: Flying Colors</h2>
            <h3>Percussionist (Vibraphone)</h3>
            <p>
                Over the pandemic, I was able to learn a mallet percussion duet with another
                CMU student. We played "Flying Colors" by Adam Tan. It was a lot of fun to get
                back into in-person music!
